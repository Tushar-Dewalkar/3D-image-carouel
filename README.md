# 3D Carousel

This is a 3D carousel created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows you to showcase a collection of images or videos in a rotating manner, providing an interactive and visually appealing experience.

## Getting Started

To run the carousel locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
git clone https://github.com/Tushar-Dewalkar/3D-image-carouel
cd 3d-carousel


2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Features

- 3D Carousel effect: The images or videos are arranged on a circular path and can be rotated using the mouse or touch gestures.

- Auto-rotate option: The carousel can automatically rotate the items, providing a dynamic display.

- Customizable settings: The carousel offers various configuration options, such as the radius, image size, background music, etc.

## Usage

Add your images or videos to the `#spin-container` in the `index.html` file:

html
<div id="drag-container">
  <div id="spin-container">
    <!-- Add your images or videos here -->
    <img src="path/to/image1.jpg" alt="">
    <img src="path/to/image2.jpg" alt="">
    <!-- Add more images or videos as needed -->
  </div>
  <div id="ground"></div>
</div>


Customize the carousel settings in the `script.js` file:

javascript
var radius = 240; // how big of the radius
var autoRotate = true; // auto rotate or not
var rotateSpeed = -60; // unit: seconds/360 degrees
var imgWidth = 120; // width of images (unit: px)
var imgHeight = 170; // height of images (unit: px)

// Link of background music - set 'null' if you dont want to play background music
var bgMusicURL = "path/to/background_music.mp3";
var bgMusicControls = true; // Show UI music control
// Add more settings as needed
// ...
